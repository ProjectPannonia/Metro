                        <p>
                            Currently at the heart of the company are around 80 talented designers, programmers, artists, sound specialists and writers, with years of experience in software development and computer games in particular.

                            Creative Director Andrey Prokhorov has this to say about the studio:
                            “The Ukrainian game development industry was formed from self-taught people, enthusiasts who learned by trial and error. Coming from various backgrounds – engineers, musicians, movie directors, painters, scientists and even the military - this diversity gives our studio a certain uniqueness in the way we create games. All new people are carefully selected to fit perfectly into the team. We never pursue quantity to the prejudice of quality, and the smaller size of our studio allows for a unique creative process in a friendly atmosphere.”
